# Bootcamp Mobile SP
This repository contains some programming challenges proposed by the Sophos Bootcamp Mobile. These challenges have been solved with the swift language.


## Challenge 1

a. Create a method that generates and returns a text string (String) randomly with a length equal to 10 characters, and that will be only numbers (0-9), for example "3845346790". The method will take a text value as input. The text string that is returned will have the following two conditions:

 - If the input value is equal to "TypeA" the text string should start at "54".
 - If the input value is equal to "TypeB" the text string should start at "08".

This means that, through the console, enter “TypeA” and it prints “54********” on the console and if I enter “TypeB” it prints “08********” on the console.

b. Create a function that sorts and returns an array of numbers.

The function will receive a list of random numbers. (You can use the same method that was used in point a). and one additional parameter. “Asc” or “Desc” to indicate if it should be ordered from smallest to largest or from largest to smallest.

It is not possible to use functions of the language that resolve it automatically.

This means that, through the console, enter "Asc" and the console prints "0,2,4,6,8,10,23,43" and if I enter "Desc" it prints the console "43,23,10 ,8,6,4,2,0”.

## Challenge 2

Create an app that simulates a roll of a dice, the roll must be done by means of a button.

Between each launch, the faces must be changed randomly, taking into account that the number or face that is going to be shown is the upper face.
